# Simulating-ecology-multiple-stressors
Repository for ecological simulations relating to multiple stressors

Scripts investigate different modelling approaches and how to conduct these, as well as power analysis and consideration of biological vs statistical significance. 

Exploratory scripts are somewhat unstructured investigations, testing different techniques and approaches primarily for my own understanding and learning.

Named scripts are more formalised and structured, intended to serve as templates for further analysis. 

Redundant scripts are for record keeping, and do not contain what I now perceive to be the best approach to a particular kind of analysis, or the content of these scripts has been re-written in a more structured fashion for clarity.
